**Quotely** is a web application created using Django. As quote enthusiasts, we made the decision to bring this website to life. Creating a new quote is simple – just provide the author's name and the quote itself. To enhance the visual appeal, we've incorporated a feature that allows you to attach images to quotes, resulting in a perfect presentation.
